Using Dominic Nicacio's version of SISRS:

1. After entering the sisrs command you will be prompted:"Would you like to create a new metrics file?"
2. Metrics file refers to a text file that sisrs will output various statistics and information to at the end of each run. 
   The prompt will give you the option to wipe the metrics file clean and overwrite it with new data OR to maintain the data
   previously written to the file and to append new data from the current run to a new line in the metrics file
3. To answer Yes to the prompt, enter "1" OR to answer No, enter "2"

Using sisrs_time.txt:
-- This script can be used to wrap sisrs in other commands.
-- Operating sisrs_time.txt:
    There are two separate commands written into sisrs_time.txt:
      1. The first command in the text file is a for loop that iterates over multiple runs of sisrs for different kmer sizes.
         The command that the for loop is iterated over is usr/bin/time which takes sisrs as its argument to analyze its RAM usage.
      2. The second command (which is currently commented out) is a for loop that iterates over multiple runs of sisrs for different
         specified amounts of missing data. The command that this for loop is iterated over is a specific sisrs command "changeMissing"
         This command enables sisrs to filter the data it outputs based on the different amounts of missing data (specified in the for
         loop) without having to complete an entire run from scratch.
